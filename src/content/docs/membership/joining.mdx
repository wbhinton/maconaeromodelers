      <p class="mt-1">

           Please <strong>do not</strong> simply hand your application and cash to a random Board Member at the field. While this was done in the past, it creates tracking issues. Sending it directly to the Treasurer ensures immediate processing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does this take?
Generally, if the application is sent directly to the Treasurer, the process takes approximately **one week**.
* *Note: This time may be significantly extended if you do not deliver the package directly to the Treasurer.*

### Can I fly while my application is "In-Process"?
While not an official written policy, it is generally considered reasonable to allow an applicant to fly **only if**:
1.  The application and dues have been handed in.
2.  **AMA Status** has been verified.
3.  **Ability to fly safely** has been verified by a current member.
