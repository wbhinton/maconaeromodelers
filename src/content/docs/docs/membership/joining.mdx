We welcome new pilots to Macon Aero Modelers! The process to join is straightforward, but it involves a few verification steps to ensure we maintain our insurance and safety standards.

## The Application Process

<Steps>

1.  **Complete the Application**
    Obtain a membership application form. We prefer you fill this out **electronically** to ensure your data is legible, though a handwritten form is accepted as a backup.

2.  **Submit to the Treasurer**
    Submit your completed application and annual dues directly to the Club Treasurer, **Jim Dowdle**.
    * **Method:** Email (preferred) or Mail.
    * **Payment:** Checks (with remote deposit) are preferred.

    <Aside type="caution" title="Submission Method">
    Please **do not** simply hand your application and cash to a random Board Member at the field.
    
    While this was done in the past, it creates tracking issues and delays the process. Sending it directly to the Treasurer ensures your application is processed immediately.

3.  **Treasurer Processing**
    Upon receipt, the Treasurer will:
    * Verify your AMA status.
    * Log your payment and mark your status as "In-Process".
    * Submit your application to the Board of Directors for a vote.

4.  **Board Approval**
    The Board has approximately **48 hours** to review the application. If no dissenting votes are received within that window, the Treasurer moves forward with the membership.

5.  **Welcome & Activation**
    Once approved:
    * You are added to the official Member List.
    * You will receive a **Welcome Email** containing the membership list and club documents.
    
    **You are officially a member upon receipt of this email**.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does this take?
Generally, if the application is sent directly to the Treasurer, the process takes approximately **one week**.
* *Note: This time may be significantly extended if you do not deliver the package directly to the Treasurer.*

### Can I fly while my application is "In-Process"?
While not an official written policy, it is generally considered reasonable to allow an applicant to fly **only if**:
1.  The application and dues have been handed in.
2.  **AMA Status** has been verified.
3.  **Ability to fly safely** has been verified by a current member.

When in doubt, please wait for your Welcome Email or consult the Safety Officer before taking to the air.
